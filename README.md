# music_rec_sys
A music recommendation system using clustering for CS 274 at SJSU


In this project there are recommendation systems that are coded in R and use k-means and PAM clustering combined with cosine and Gower similarity to recommend songs. The recommendation system allows for user input. The k-means algorithm performs better having higher cluster membership, providing higher recommendation scores, and having more diverse recommendations. The PAM algorithm performs better in having more compact and well-separated clusters and having more up-to-date recommendations. It is unclear which algorithm is better, but the main goal is achieved - creating a robust recommendation system that allows for the elimination of popularity bias and lets users customize their preferences.
